                        <p>
                            Ranked second place on the IMD World Competitiveness Ranking 2019, Hong Kong overtook America for the top spots this year. Till 2019, this is the 25th year for Hong Kong to be entitled as the freest economy successively by Heritage Foundation, an American
                            think tank.
                        </p>
                        <p>Acknowledged as Asian Financial Hub, Hong Kong takes advantage of its geographical location, simple taxation structure, multicultural environment to host innumerable local and international pivotal companies. People flush into
                            this oriental city for its mixed culture and myriad job opportunities. </p>
                        <p> However, a society with a diverse population composition does not guarantee a culturally integrated society. The institute of urban strategies under the Mori Memorial Foundation in Japan assessed cities in the world from 6 aspects:
                            Economy, Research and Development, Cultural Interaction, Livability, Environment, Accessibility. Hong Kong demonstrates a competitive economy status while also reveals its weakness in cultural interaction and livability, two
                            aspects taking interaction with foreigners and social equality as attributes.
                        </p>
                        <p>According to the 2016 Hong Kong census, 8.0% of the population were non-Chinese, as known as ethnic minorities, among which 57.7% taken up by Filipino and Indonesian, followed by South Asian, Mixed and White. Among South Asian,
                            Indian has the largest population, an estimated 6.2% of all ethnic minorities in HK. </p>
                        <p>Racial hierarchy exists within the ethnic minority community, generally dominated by skin tone discrimination, reported by Zubin Foundation EM research. Darker skin color basically means larger chance of facing bias and poorer
                            possibility of integrating to this society, elaborated by Puja Kapai, Director of HKU’s Centre for Comparative and Public Law, who complied the final research report for Zubin Foundation. However, Africans are not the bottom
                            of this hierarchy, while Arabian are. </p>
                        <br/>

                                This pyramid illustrates Hong Kong racial hierarchy. Arabian unexpectedly ranked bottom and Ms Kapai pointed out the term ‘Arabian’ is full of prejudice already.

                        <p>The long history of Indian and Pakistanis in Hong Kong hasn’t been shed light on to the public. Their contribution has been underestimated. Tracing back to 1841, 2700 Indian soldiers were to Hong Kong by the British after Hong
                            Kong island was surrendered to British government in perpetuity. And in 1867, 100 Sikh policemen arrived in Hong Kong since they were recognized for their commitment to protective police work back in British India. Later in
                            1950s, nearly 200 Pakistanis came to Hong Kong for police service. </p>

                                Ethnic Minorities have contributed to Hong Kong society through being policemen, building hospitals and schools. The Sir Ellis Karoodie School founded in 1891 is still the ethnic minority parents' top choice.

                        <p>Harpinder, a 21-year-old psychology majored student at Lingnan University, is a 4th generation Hong Kong-born Indian. Her great-grandfather used to be a police officer in Hong Kong during World War 2 help fighting against Japan.
                            After that, the whole family immigrated to Hong for a brighter and more promised future.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>Harpinder is grateful to grow up in this well-developed international city with better education and exposure to other places in the world. Last year she joined the Metropolitan Attachment Program and went to Sydney for summer internship
                        with other 40ish local Chinese and one Hong Kong-born Pakistanis, Mariam XXX, whose grandfather came to Hong Kong as policeman in 1952.</p>
                    <p>Working in Sydney, surrounded by English environment is easier and more comfortable for these two as it’s hard for them to get a satisfying job as EM in Hong Kong despite the fact that both of the two university students can speak
                        fluent English and Cantonese. Harpinder firmly calls herself a Hong Konger but also admits she would definitely move out of Hong Kong later because they can never have the job privilege as “local”, while actually this 4th generation
                        Hong Kong-born Indian girl should be acknowledged as local, by others and herself.</p>
                    <p>Harpinder is one of the many youths struggling in Hong Kong as a local born ethnic minority kid. The Zubin Mahtani Gidumal Foundation (short as Zubin Foundation), a Hong Kong social study think tank, once interviewed 253 ethnic minority
                        youths in Hong Kong about their aspiration challenge and identity problem. Like Harpinder, half recognized themselves as Hong Konger while planning to leave Hong Kong within 10 years in order to live in an English-speaking society
                        for more fair job opportunities. </p>
                    <p>Talking to Mariam, she felt the term ‘Ethnic Minorities’ contains multiple segments, from local-born non-Chinese to non-local non-Chinese, and also asylum seekers. These non-Chinese youths born and raised in Hong Kong, the term EM
                        denies their identity as a local person , thus they would be preferred to be called as ‘Hong Kong Plus’ to indicate their identity, which is quite clear from the day they born.</p>

        <!-- Footer -->
        <section id="footer" class="wrapper">
            <div id="tencent" class="title">Education and Employment</div>
            <div class="container">

                <p>Compared to 10 years ago, the ethnic minority community in Hong Kong has expanded significantly by 70. The boost in the EM population has made Hong Kong a more integrated society, but it’s not negligible that racism and discrimination
                    still exist in Hong Kong in different contexts like job opportunities and education. “Hong Kong claims to be multiculturalism while actually didn’t embrace it at all”, commented by Mariam. Sometimes companies may turn down their job
                    applications under the pretext of Cantonese proficiency requirement or religious attire. </p>

                <p>Discrimination is easy to spot and felt, said by Harpinder. It’s common to see some local Chinese, mostly elderly, cover their noses with tissue when they spot her or other brown people taking public transportation. “Stop covering your
                    nose with the tissue. We take shower everyday just the same as local. We don’t smell as you thought.”, she once posted on her Instagram story after facing such awkward scene in an elevator.</p>
                <p>The discrimination reflects poor cultural integration,. “I think the systematic discrimination originated from education. Government needs to fix the system.”, Harpinder said. Hong Kong government currently implements the Chinese as Second
                    Language System to facilitate non-Chinese ethnic minorities with their Chinese study. “But they don’t even have Cantonese textbooks for us ethnic minorities and we often learn Cantonese from a much easier level than locals.”, Harpinder
                    supplemented.
                </p>
                <p>The inherent segregation hidden within the education is approved by Harpinder and Mariam. “It’s segregated. They already assumed us could not speak Cantonese well”. The road for EM youths to integrate to the local society becomes harder
                    when not learning Cantonese as first language, added by Mariam.</p>
                <p>Currently EM need to take alternative international Chinese qualification exams for college entrance but the equivalence to DSE Chinese examination is low and hinder them from choosing certain university major with the requirement of minimum
                    level 3 of HKDSE examination. </p>
                <p>Mariam studied psychology at university and thought about doing counselling in the future but without a DSE language certificate, GCE is not equivalent to prove she proficiency in Cantonese. Pursuing a professional career fitting her major
                    study is challenging and she starts to consider working outside of Hong Kong.</p>
                <p>Designated school is another implementation receiving criticism from EM, NGO and even United Nations for obstructing integration. Designated schools used to be the place for EM children to attend in which medium of instruction is English
                    rather than Chinese. The schools were considered promoting segregation since no real cultural interaction with local Chinese could possibly be made in these schools. </p>
                <p>However, even after these schools got disbanded by government in 2013, the tendency of sending kids to particular schools never stop. Considering EM parents of middle-class or below cannot afford the expense of international school, and
                    these children don’t learn Chinese from born as local Chinese do, they rather prefer to attend former designated schools, which becomes parts of EMI(English Medium Instruction) schools now. For instance, Sir Ellis Kadoori and Broadway
                    are famous for having a lot of EMs.</p>
                <p>Being a student from EMI school, Mariam insists they should be given the option to learn Cantonese as first language. “They need language to feel part of the society”, a parent raised her opinion at the townhall meeting with Matthew Cheung
                    in 2017.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>The lack of Cantonese skills also presents barriers for EM in employment, resulting in increasing poverty within EM family. </p>
                <p>In 2016, the unemployment rate of EM is 4.6%, 1.3% higher than average. And the poverty rate among EM has reached 19.4%, increasing by 3.6% from 2011, which means almost one in five ethnic minorities are below the poverty line. “Some 34
                    per cent of young can’t find work, which is way above the overall unemployment rate of 3.%. And for women, the situation is even worse”, said by Puja Kapai, Director of HKU’s Centre for Comparative and Public Law, “Lack of employment
                    or employment in low-skilled labour jobs also means that poverty levels are high for ethnic minorities. Around 32% of children from these families are living in poverty. It’s a vicious cycle.”</p>
                <p>The Labour Department kicked off its interactive job seeking online service from 2010, through which job seekers can have a glance of the job market and possibly find a job after successful application. Since March 2015, the new option
                    ‘Ethnic Minorities are welcomed for the post’ in its job vacancy form for employers was introduced in order to help EM job seekers get employed and encourage companies recruit more EM in the workspace.

                </p>
                <p>However, only 485 out of 24772 job vacancies listed on the job portal are EM friendly and 60.6% of them are labor jobs without requirement on academic qualification such as cleaner, security guard, dish washer and courier. Only few managerial
                    positions are offered with a requirement in bachelor or master degree. And the highest salary for such position is around 50,000 per month, while the peak for non-EM is approximately 140,000, 3 times as much as the top salary for EM.</p>

                <p>“Language and career opportunities are the main problems faced by EM youths. We offered skill training classes and dedicated to help them to find a job.”, said by Sandy Chan, the manager of Zubin Foundation. Based on her experience, EM
                    youths don’t actively build up their profiles to find decent internship or jobs, and sometimes even not interested in study. Sandy personally knew several youths went to Vocational Training College but quit in year 2 or half or year
                    1 so they could go to construction site for higher salary. </p>
                <p>EM youths tend to do similar jobs now, mostly either English teacher or waiter and waitress. The monotonous work leads to bias of job market and generates awkwardness when exception happens. Sandy once met a girl majoring in chemistry
                    in university and passionate about being a chemistry teacher. She successfully got admitted after applying for around 100 schools, while several schools replied with asking her whether she can teach English instead. </p>
                <p>
                    But things apparently did not turn out to be better when she was required to take off her hijab at school. “Such disrespectful behavior is unreasonable and disrespectful”, Sandy added. And such ignorance is derived from the unfamiliarity with other culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Acknowledging EM’s existence is not enough, Hong Kong people need to accept them to your colleagues at workplace, and classmates of your children.”, she commented.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Housing in Hong Kong is another issue Harpinder concerns. “We cannot buy houses here so I don’t see a reason to stuck in Hong Kong”. Knowing American schools will reserve certain quotas for kids with different ethnicity, Harpinder suggests Hong Kong government
                    to implement such policies to maintain the fairness.
                </p>
                <p>For new incoming EMs, renting a house is challenging as well. The Zubin Foundation provides service of helping EM rent houses and they’ve once called over 10 property agents but the agents all rejected their requests since the landlords
                    prefer not to rent their houses to EM tenants. “They either assumed EM will host disturbing party all night or thought EM have hygiene problems and may not pay the rent on time, which are all wrong assumptions with strong intentional
                    bias.”, Sandy added. </p>
                <p>Misleading assumptions tears up the gap between the two groups. People being judgmental in a too easy and irresponsible way, sometimes even without working or knowing EM personally in real life. Going through the popular online forums
                    among Hong Kong youths, LIHKG, hate speech spams the posts regarding EM, mostly South Asian. Dirty, violent, collective, unemployed, lazy, rape criminals are the common words used in these posts. Netizens shared the anecdotes they
                    heard from others without verification that could justify their opinions with prejudice. </p>
                <p>Hong Kong local media HK01 once hosted a program inviting 2 EM young boys reading the hate comments towards EM. The boys looked awkward after hearing the comment but still responded gently and emphasized for multiple times that people
                    should not do generalization based on the bad-behaved individuals. However, the comments of the video are still full of preconceived tease and discrimination. </p>
